            <p>Within 48 hours, teams were asked to <strong>decide on an issue to address
              </strong> and <strong> design a screen-based solution</strong>. After multiple calls and
              brainstorming sessions, my team decided to tackle <strong>sustainable
                activsim</strong>. The wildfires on the West Coast were rampant during
              this designathon, and our team found it fit to design an app
              that could bring attention to the dangers of climate change and
              present possible solutions for individuals who want to help the
              environment.</p>

              more personal problem?</p>
            <p>“Climate change is an issue” - and that’s where most people stop.
              While many people are aware of climate change, many feel helpless
              or overwhelmed by the breadth of the issue; “how could I, as an
              individual, make an impact on this earth?” Many people don’t believe
              climate change affects them because it feels invisible and like a
              distant problem, so <strong>how can we make climate change a more personal
                problem to individuals and encourage them to make actionable changes
                to their consumption behaviors</strong>?</p>

              and are the forefront of youth activism and social change.</p>
            <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong><br>Consumers want to purchase
              healthy options, but there is an overload of information or
              prices are too high, or sustainable options aren’t as available</p>
            <ul>
              <li>People don’t understand the urgency of climate change, it
                does not affect them personally so why change their habits</li>
              <li>Even those who want to change their behaviors feel

              <p class="split-column"><strong>Accessibility:</strong> To make our design as acessible as possible,
              we made sure that all background and foreground colors had a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 according
              to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). In the earlier iterations of our design, we
              had poor color contrast with the navigation bar, as shown on the left. Additionally, we followed
              iOS Typography Guidelines to maximize readability.

            <p><strong>Onboarding:</strong> For our onboarding process, we
              wanted to make it both personable and straightforward. Firstly,
              we opted to ask for the user's first and last name at the beginning,
              enabling the following screen to be personalized with the user’s name. </p>

            <p><strong>Overall Branding:</strong> For overall branding, we
            wanted our app to look clean and appeal to a younger audience.
            Thus, we chose two-dimensional illustrations, pastel colors,
            and all lowercase headers to give off a chill, approachable vibe. The app's primary color, a muted green, envokes
            themes of sustainability and growth. To make illustrations
            seamlessly blend in with the overall interface, we decided to
            add a black stroke to most boxes and buttons for clear continuity
            and closure. </p>

            <p class="main-subheader">Focusing on our strengths as a team</p>
            <p>Just Design was my third designation, and it was one of the most
              smooth and efficient experience I’ve had. On our first call as a
              team, we immediately started by getting to know each other as people,
              students, and designers.<strong>We made it clear what our strengths
              and weaknesses were right off the bat</strong>, which made
              delegating tasks both quick and straightforward. <br><br>

              Chintan and I found our strengths in high-fidelity prototyping,
              while Nicole and Arina were both confident in user research and
              ideation. <strong>We funneled our focus and attention where we
              felt the most confident and felt the happiest doing</strong>,
              without missing out on the entire design process.</p>
            <p class="main-subheader">User research & usability testing</p>
            <p>Due to the time constraint and the high-speed nature of weekend
              designathons, we did not have time to conduct user interviews,
              create personas, or go through multiple rounds design iterations
              and user feedback. If I had more time, I would conduct more
              research and interviews to understand users better and create a
              solid foundation before designing</p>
