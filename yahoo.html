            <p>During my 9-week internship at Verizon Media 
              (Yahoo!) as a Product Design Intern, I worked on 
              various projects for Yahoo Home, Yahoo News, and 
              Yahoo‚Äôs Design System. Since most of these projects are close 
              to public release/shipment, I want to share a <strong>high-level overview of 
              my learnings and takeaways</strong>.
              Overall, I dived into four different areas of design during my internship: <strong>prototyping, UX 
              research, visual design,</strong> and <strong>interaction design</strong>.

            <p>During the first weeks of my internship, I worked as a 
              <strong>design prototyper</strong>, assisting different teams with 
              prototyping, designing solutions, and iterating on 
              mockups. As a designer and developer hybrid, I worked 
              with the Yahoo Home design team to create high-fidelity, 
              coded prototypes that housed different flows, 
              interactions, and states. Two of the design prototyping projects I worked on were:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Yahoo Home Personal Finance Prototype, with Ellen Kim (Designer) and Andy Jin (UX Researcher)</li>
              <li>Yahoo Home Module Picker, with Bryan Farevaag (Designer) and Tyson Gushiken (Designer/Mentor)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Both of these prototypes and their features are in production. With these high-fidelity prototypes, I was often given 
              mockups via Sketch and InVision. I then coded 
              high-fidelity interfaces and flows while providing 
              my own design feedback and, most importantly, <strong>expressing 
                my creative freedom on small micro-interactions and 
                animation</strong>. My prototyping process:

            <p>During my internship, I worked with Andy Jin on Yahoo's UXR Team to put 
              the Personal Finance prototype I coded through moderated testing. It was amazing

                      You know the drill.</strong><br>

                    We were able to test what flows felt intuitive to users while 
                    uncovering design components and steps that prompted the 
                    most confusion.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Listening to users' thoughts and first impressions 
                      in the moment.</strong><br>

                    While usability testing is valuable, having users interact with 
                    our prototypes and conversing with them allows us to understand 
                    their needs, concerns, and wants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, one user professed their uneasiness due to privacy concerns 
                    and data breaches while interacting with the personal finance prototype. This prompted the team to brainstorm   
                    design solutions to make users 
                    feel more safe and secure with our product.

                      B2C companies).</strong><br>

                    One of my  favorite takeaways from UXR was seeing how users were 
                    excited for certain features we were testing out. Hearing ‚Äúoh my

              source of truth.</p>
              
            <p>This project consisted of two parts. First,
              designing a Figma template to enforce a consistent, standarized format 
              for all design documentation.
              I also brainstormed ways to take advantage of Figma‚Äôs component feature 
              to make it easier for designers to input new documentation for the main website.
              Secondly, creating a sample website to prototype different features such 
              as a search feature.
            </p>

            <p>With this project, I worked on the visual layout of the documentation website
              and interactions with various components on the page, from a hovering drawer to 
              a dynamic content nav.

            </div>
            <p>During my internship, I worked with Lucia Chen (Designer), Ryan McCullah and Tyson Gushiken (Creative Direction) on swipe interactions for 
              Yahoo News and prototyped various versions via Protopie. For this project, 
              I iterated on the motion of UI elements to balance both user delight and utility. 
              On each iteration, I collaborated with design leadership to hone the swipe 
              interaction with meaningful and natural animations.</p>

            <p style="color: var(--navy);" class="yahoo-main-header">Project Introduction</p>
            <p>
              I was asked to prototype a swipe interaction for Yahoo article components, 
              in which users could swipe left or right on a component to 
              reveal actions such as seeing more of a post, sharing it, and 
              so on. Ideally, this interaction could be universal to many Yahoo
              products. 
            </p>
            <img style="margin-bottom: 8px;" src="images/yahoo/fuji-stream.png" alt="">
            <p class="figure-caption" style="margin-bottom: 32px;">
              Different article components via Yahoo News<br>
            <p>At the start of the project, I was given a sketch file with specific 
              dimensions for the swipe interaction. For example, when the user swipes 42px to the right, 
              the first revealed action would be 30px, and so on.
            </p>
            <img src="images/yahoo/fuji-mockups.png" alt="">
            <p class="figure-caption">A preview of the first Sketch mockup I was sent.</p>
            <p style="color: var(--navy);" class="yahoo-main-header">Iterations</p>
            <p>After translating the static mocks to an interactive prototype, we realized 
              that we had a long way to go with the interaction. There was a lot of
               movement going on: the ‚ÄúSee less like this‚Äù text appearing as the user 
               swiped, in addition to moving and growing buttons. We felt like the interaction 
               had too many moving components, which can potentially disorient or overwhelm 
               the user. 
            </p>
            <p>With this in mind, I went through the first iteration: </p>
            <div class="swipe-container">
              <img src="images/yahoo/swipe-static.gif" alt="">
              <!-- <p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Keep the location of the button consistent, but have buttons grow as 
                the user swiped to map the actions to the user‚Äôs swipe</p> -->
              <div class="circle-and-text-container">
                <div class="circle-and-text">
                  <div>
                      <div class="interaction-circles">1</div>
                  </div>
                  <div class="decision-text">
                    <h4 class="yahoo-decisions-header">Static position</h4>
                    <p class="task-body">Keep the location of the button consistent, 
                      but have buttons grow as 
                      the user swiped to map the actions to the user‚Äôs swipe.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>While this worked fine for the short stack components,
              the interaction became increasingly complicated when it came to ‚ÄúSlim Jims,‚Äù 
              where there are two longer stories adjacent to each other. 
            </p>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 32px;">
              <div>
                <img style="width: 500px; margin-bottom: 0px;" src="images/yahoo/silm-jim-swipe.gif" alt="">
                <p class="figure-caption">Swiping the left Slim Jim.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>Because the Slim Jims overlap on swipe, the swiped card and associated 
              buttons become blurred. For example: when the left Slim Jim is swiped, 
              the Slim Jim on the right disappears. Users could either associate the revealed 
              actions to:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The left Slim Jim, because that is the card they swiped, or 
                <img style="max-width: 600px" src="images/yahoo/scenario-1.png" alt="">
              </li>
              <li>The right Slim Jim, because the revealed actions took the place of the disappeared card.
                <img style="max-width: 600px" src="images/yahoo/scenario-2.png" alt="">
              </li>
            </ol>
            <!-- <img style="width: 500px" src="images/yahoo/misconceptions.png" alt=""> -->
            <p><em>Confusing, huh.</em></p>
            <p>Consequently, I had to brainstorm an interaction that would be both delightful 
              and intuitive for all article dimensions: short stack, Slim Jims, and 
              wide components. After brainstorming and seeking advice from various 
              designers, I came across the second iteration:
            </p>
            <div class="swipe-container" style="margin-top: 56px;">
              <img class="img-shadow" src="images/yahoo/final-swipes.gif" alt="">
              <!-- <p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Keep the location of the button consistent, but have buttons grow as 
                the user swiped to map the actions to the user‚Äôs swipe</p> -->
              <div class="circle-and-text-container">
                <div class="circle-and-text">
                  <div>
                      <div class="interaction-circles">2</div>
                  </div>
                  <div class="decision-text">
                    <h4 class="yahoo-decisions-header">Snap to center</h4>
                    <p class="task-body">Have buttons follow the user‚Äôs swipe, and recenter on release.</p> <br>
                    <p>The buttons follow the card the user swipes on. <strong>
                      This further reinforces the 
                      relationship between the swiped card and the actions associated 
                      with that card.
                    </strong>
                      I removed the button scale from the previous 
                      interaction to reduce the overall movement of the interaction 
                      so that it wasn‚Äôt too overwhelming. 
                      Lastly, the buttons snap into center position once the 
                      user releases the card for consistency and ease of use. </p>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="swipe-container" style="margin-top: 86px;">
              <img class="img-shadow" src="images/yahoo/slim-jim-scale.gif" alt="">
              <div class="circle-and-text-container">

                  <div class="decision-text">
                    <h4 class="yahoo-decisions-header">Delightful</h4>
                    <p>Lastly, I wanted to create a more delightful and smooth experience by having the 
                      disappearing Slim Jim scale and fade. This adds more dimemsion to the interaction.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </div>

            </div>

                    <p>Because this swipe interaction does not have any explicit signifiers, I 
                      decided to incorperate onboarding tooltips. I made sure that this format 
                      matched an existing onboarding flow on the Yahoo News app.

                <p><strong>Feedback is a gift.
                </strong> <br>
                  It took me a couple weeks to break out of my shell, and when I did, 
                  it was so worth it! I learned so much more after chatting with other 
                  designers and asking them for design feedback. The designers at Yahoo would 
                  always give me detailed rationales, which I really appreciated!
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Taking design to the next level and making it delightful.</strong><br>
                  I was so stuck on designing interfaces that I forgot about the complexity but 
                  benefits of animations. Through coding prototypes and working with JS animation libraries, 
                  I began to really appreciate the power of animation/motion design.

              <li>
                <p>Big big shout to Tyson Gushiken for being such an amazing mentor. He guided me throughout the 9-weeks 
                  and set me up with projects that I genuinely enjoyed working on. After meeting him, I felt validated 
                  in my skills as a UX engineer and designer. He showed me the various benefits of design prototyping and 
                  gave me so many tips and tricks along the way. Also big thank you to Nina Ristani for 
                  being the best manager I could've ever asked for!</p>
