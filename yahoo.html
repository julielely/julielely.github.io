            <p>During my 9-week internship at Verizon Media 
              (Yahoo!) as a Product Design Intern, I worked on 
              various projects for Yahoo Home, Yahoo News, and 
              Yahoo‚Äôs Design System. Since most of these projects are still
              in production, I want to share a <strong>high-level overview of 
              my learnings and takeaways</strong>. Once they are available to the 
              public, I'll update this page with images. Stay tuned!
              Overall, I dived into four different areas of design during my internship: <strong>prototyping, UX 
              research, visual design,</strong> and <strong>interaction design</strong>.

            <p>During the first weeks of my internship, I worked as a 
              <strong>design prototyper</strong>, assisting different teams with 
              prototyping, designing solutions, and iterating on 
              mockups. As a designer and developer hybrid, I worked 
              with the Yahoo Home design team to create high-fidelity, 
              coded prototypes that housed different flows, 
              interactions, and states. 
            </p>
            <p>
              With these high-fidelity prototypes, I was often given 
              mockups via Sketch and InVision.  I then coded 
              high-fidelity interfaces and flows while providing 
              my own design feedback and, most importantly, <strong>expressing 
                my creative freedom on small micro-interactions and 
                animation</strong>. My prototyping process:

                    <strong>Complex and interactive prototypes</strong><br>
                    With coded prototypes, you can house various flows and states. 
                    For example, one of the coded prototypes showed empty and 
                    preview states while dynamically changing ‚Äúdummy-data‚Äù 
                    based on user interaction. Users could also interact with 
                    different modals depending on the scenario‚Äîall in one prototype.

                    <strong>Smooth interactions and animation</strong><br>
                    While I‚Äôm a big fan of Figma and InVision, many 
                    prototyping tools lack flexibility, technicality, 
                    and/or buttery transitions. With coded prototypes, 
                    I could customize animations and motion to my liking 
                    while taking into account when they could be triggered 
                    based on user journeys. Engineers could also inspect my code 
                    to understand the animation side better.

                    High-fidelity prototypes that are literally 
                    the real deal, minus the back-end-data-jazz. When users 
                    interact with it, it feels as if it‚Äôs the actual website. These 
                    prototypes are super helpful for design discussions, user testing, 
                    and engineering handoff.

            <p>During my internship, I was able to work with Yahoo's UXR Team to put 
              a prototype I coded through moderated testing. It was amazing 
              to see the power of high-fidelity prototypes.

                      You know the drill.</strong><br>

                    We were able to test what flows felt intuitive to users while 
                    uncovering design components and steps that prompted the 
                    most confusion.

                    <strong>Listening to users' thoughts and first impressions 
                      in the moment.</strong><br>

                    While usability testing is valuable, having users interact with 
                    our prototypes and conversing with them allows us to understand 
                    their needs, concerns, and wants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, we tested a prototype related to bank accounts, 
                    and one user professed their uneasiness due to privacy concerns 
                    and data breaches. In turn, we were prompted to go back to the 
                    drawing board to understand and design solutions to make users 
                    feel more safe and secure with our product.

                    One of my  favorite takeaways from UXR was seeing how users were 
                    excited for certain features we were testing out. Hearing ‚Äúoh my

            <p>As my last project, I worked with my mentor to find a way to 
              standardize documentation for Yahoo‚Äôs design system‚Äîthe single 
              source of truth.</p>
              
            <p>This project consisted of two parts. First,
              designing a Figma template to enforce a consistent, standarized format 
              for all design documentation.
              I also brainstormed ways to take advantage of Figma‚Äôs component feature 
              to make it easier for designers to input new documentation for the main website.
              Secondly, creating a sample website to prototype different features such 
              as a search feature.
            </p>

            <p>With this project, I worked on the visual layout of the documentation website
              and interactions with various components on the page, from a hovering drawer to 
              a dynamic content nav.

                <p><strong>Feedback is a gift.
                </strong> <br>
                  It took me a couple weeks to break out of my shell, and when I did, 
                  it was so worth it! I learned so much more after chatting with other 
                  designers and asking them for design feedback. The designers at Yahoo would 
                  always give me detailed rationales, which I really appreciated!
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Taking design to the next level and making it delightful.</strong><br>
                  I was so stuck on designing interfaces that I forgot about the complexity but 
                  benefits of animations. Through coding prototypes and working with JS animation libraries, 
                  I began to really appreciate the power of animation/motion design.

                <p>Big big shout to Tyson Gushiken for being such an amazing mentor. He guided me throughout the 9-weeks 
                  and set me up with projects that I genuinely enjoyed working on. After meeting him, I felt validated 
                  in my skills as a UX engineer and designer. He showed me the various benefits of design prototyping and 
                  gave me so many tips and tricks along the way. </p>
