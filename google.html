              to <strong>share answers and advice</strong>. Consider the needs of a student

            <p>
              Adjusting to campus life as a new student is a <strong>big deal</strong>—it can
              be nerve-wracking and challenging. At Wellesley,
              first semester grades are mandatory pass/fail so students
              can prioritize adjusting to college life.
              <br><br>
              Facebook and GroupMe are two popular platforms Wellesley students
              use to ask questions and share resources. However, these platforms
              are highly saturated with other content, which clutters
              relevant information or questions shared by students. <strong>How might
              we improve communication between students and allow a streamlined
              process for students to get their questions answered while
              promoting mentorship and community?</strong>

         <p>Students seeking help or asking questions can be a freshman, a senior,
           or even a transfer student. While the prompt makes a clear
           distinction between “new” and “experienced” questions, the person
           answering a question does not always have to be experienced or older.
           Anyone can ask, anyone can answer. At Wellesley, first-years often confide
           in their peers, as well as seniors for advice or questions. <strong>This application
           aims to provide a supportive space for all students, with additional features
           for new students.</strong>

          <p class="main-subheader">Diving into Material Design</p>
          <p>For this design exercise, I decided to use <strong>Google's Material Design</strong> components and
          guidelines. This was the first time I worked in a foreign design system, and I was in awe
          by the intention and purpose behind each component. Here are a few design decisions I made
        based on Material Design components and guidelines:</p>
         <img src="images/google/design_decisions.jpg" alt="Design decisions">
         <p>The filter bar and expanded few of the filter options replicate the layout of Google Maps and Google Drive.
         Thus, it is optimized to <strong>blend with the rest of the Google Suite applications.</strong>
         After two rounds of usability testing, users found the overall application intuitive.</p>

            <p class="google-main-header"> Takeaways & Next Steps</p>
            <p class="main-subheader">Intentional Design</p>
            <p>As I was exploring the Material Design compontents, I learned more ways to be
              purposeful with design through compontent and guideline documentation. Additionally,
              it was a refreshing experience working in a different design system.
              While working within the Material Design system, I learned the importance of creating a cohesive brand
              and creating components that afford accessibility and intuition.
              As a designer, I hope to be confident in my own brand and voice while at the same time,
              be adaptable to different design styles or systems.
            </p>
            <p class="main-subheader">Next Steps</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Conducting more user interviews and usability tests with a larger population of Wellesley students</li>
              <li>Fleshing out the "Mentor" feature to provide students and mentors with more resources to connect
              and support each other</li>
              <li>Explore student culture and mentorship at larger universities</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <p class="main-subheader">Digging Deeper</p>
            <p>As I was doing research on users and discovering student needs, I was surprised
            to see the common themes when student asked questions. </p> -->
