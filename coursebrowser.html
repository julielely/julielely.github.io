            <p> Twice a year, Wellesley students flock to our course browser to search for
            classes to take. Since Wellesley is a liberal arts college, students must
            take specific classes to fulfill various requirements, such as the Foreign Language Requirement,
            Humanities Distribution, and more. However, <strong>the problem is that there is no easy or 
            straightforward way to keep track of degree progress.</strong><br><br>

            With no all-in-one solution available for students to plan their schedules, 
            we are presented with a design opportunity: <strong>How can we provide students with intuitive, clear, and visually appealing tools to help
            students search for classes and quantify their degree progress?</strong>

            <p>In order for a student to successfully obtain their degree at Wellesley,

              in addition to other degree requirements such as the Foreign Language and PE requirement.</p>

            <img class="img-shadow" src="images/coursebrowser/information-architecture.png" alt="">
            <p>We decided to include a distribution requirements page that
              would allow students to enter in their courses and have the website
              automatically show their progress for various degree requirements. Our goal is 
              to <strong>allow users to understand their degree progress and show what requirements they have fulfilled/what they are missing.</strong>
              With the distribution feature, students can go through the following user journey:

              This would be integrated in the course browser with other features
              such as “Rate-My-Professor” and a schedule builder. With the combination of these key features,
              we aimed to <strong>reduce bounce rates</strong> from our course browser and
              <strong>streamline the schedule planning process to improve user engagement</strong>. </p>

            <p>The most crucial and challenging interaction was adding classes.
            Because I was in charge of designing and coding the distributions
            feature, I was well aware of the cost of each design, as well as it’s difficulty development wise.
            The distribution feature has two parts: 1) Entering course history and 2) Displaying 
            what distributions each course fulfilled. 
            </p>
            <p class="key-header"><strong>Step 1: Add Courses</strong></p>
            <p>Before we can show students their degree process, we have to understand their course history first. 
              We had two options: 
              <ol>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Have students enter their full course history in the beginning</li>
                <li>Individually input classes</li>
              </ol>

            <p class="figure-caption" style=" margin: 0px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Sketches/wireframe of entering course history</p>

              While I mocked up both versions, I felt that the first option, having students enter 
              their full course history, could easily turn users away from the distribution feature. To avoid 
              a long and tedious onboarding process, I opted for the second choice. Thus, I implemented a
              "quick add feature" so that students could cherry pick classes they took to see what requirements 
              that class could fulfill. The quick add feature is also optimal since it would be quick to implement on the 
              development side.

            were difficult to sort and detect in the back end. <strong>After conducting usability tests with
            4 different students, all students experienced similiar difficulties</strong>.

            <p><br>We went through various iterations of the manual add feature
               and ended up choosing choice 3 (below) because of its simple and intuitive
               layout. We tried our best to minimize the amount of steps users
              would have to perform to manually add a class (Hick's Law). While the second
              design has less steps, it lacks flexibility and customization that
              the third design provides.</p>
            <img src="images/coursebrowser/sidebar.jpg" alt="Design iterations">
            <p>Because I was also developing this feature, I had to think of various edge 
              cases that could potentially break the back-end. Due to time constraints, 
              I decided to implement a low-cost, high-impact solution by including a 
              toast notification. <br><br> If a student tried to add a class they already 
              entered or input a course code that did not exist, we would notify the 
              user that the system did not add the particular course. I made sure to 
              design the toast notification based on existing design patterns and common 
              color archetypes (red = error/action failed) to make the toast easy to 
              comprehend.

            <p>After sharing the live site to the
              Wellesley sophomore and junior Facebook groups for beta testing,
              we currently have <strong>287 users</strong> (as of 09/01/21) and expect to
              have more after releasing it to freshman and seniors.
              The team released a feedback form, and most of the distribution
              feature feedback was positive. Student testimonials include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>“Distributions feature is extremely helpful. <strong>It helps me
                map out the courses I need to take</strong>. Specifically, I like the
                follow up option/question asking me to add additional courses to
                the language requirement part.”</li>
              <li>“...it was <strong>visually easy to see what I was missing</strong> and I appreciate that it saves.”</li>
              <li>“It's a great way of visualizing it that makes more sense than the current audit form Wellesley provides.”</li>
              <li>“[The distribution feature is] not available in other Wellesley resources (usually have to do by hand).”</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="main-subheader">Next Steps</p>
            <p>
              If I had more time on this project, I would do the following things differently:
              <ol>
                <li>Experiment with the quick add bar on the left instead of the right. This would
                  allow the bar to be more discoverable given <strong>Z scanning patterns</strong>. It
                  would also solve usability problems mentioned earlier.
                </li>
                <li>Right side drawers are often collapsable, so allowing the quick add bar to expand or 
                  collapse could give more room for the degree progress visualization on the left.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Some features that I hope to implement in the future is
              providing users with recommonded courses and major progress. Additionally,
            students wanted to see an edit feature to allow them to delete individual classes from
            the distributions page. To address this issue, we decided to add a reset all button as a temporary solution.
            Lastly, many students asked for a search feature for the course browser!</p>
