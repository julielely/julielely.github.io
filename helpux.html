          stage of the design process, from user-analysis and ideation to
          prototyping and user feedback. It allows designers to feel less
          isolated during the pandemic, while also allowing them to physically
          see their ideas come to life.

            <p>For this hackathon, I teamed up with my Wellesley classmates
              Eugenia and Katie. We all took CS220 - Human-Computer Interaction
              and fell in love with HCI, design, and Figma! Teams were asked
              to design a solution to one of the two prompts: “Bring joy to
              the world” or “Make design more accessible.” With our HCI
              knowledge fresh in our minds, we decided to pursue the
              <strong>“Make design more accessible”</strong> prompt and create a digital
              solution in 24 hours.</p>

            <p class="article-main-header">The Problem</p>
            <p class="main-subheader">How do we make design more accessible?</p>
            <p>As new designers, we went back in time to the first days of our
              HCI class and our discovery of UI/UX design. To all three of
              us—and voiced by many of our peers—one of the most common
              thoughts that came into our mind when we started design was:
              “where exactly do I start?” Navigating through the design
              process is quite daunting, so <strong>how can we make design both
                accessible, approachable, and fun to newcomers?</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Walk through the design process step by step</strong><br>
                  After taking our HCI class, we wanted to share what we
                  learned in class in an easy and fun way. From empathy maps
                  and personas to high fidelity prototyping, we wanted to make
                  each step of the design process clear and straightforward.</p>
                <p><strong>Create a collaborative and fun virtual environment</strong><br>
                  We also took our HCI class remotely and often felt disconnected—and
                  almost isolated—during our group zoom calls. During one of our
                  lectures, our professor asked students to design VR rooms through
                  Mozilla Hub to recreate the HCI lab at Wellesley College since we
                  weren’t able to experience it in person. <strong>We found that VR could
                    be a great solution to make ourselves seem less disconnected
                    during the pandemic.</strong></p>

            <p class="main-subheader">Focusing on our strengths as a team</p>
            <p>This was my third designathon, and it was one of the most
              smooth and efficient experience I’ve had. On our first call as a team,
              we immediately started with getting to know each other as both people,
              students, and designers. <strong>We made it clear what our strengths and
                weaknesses are right off the bat</strong>, which made delegating tasks
              both quick and straightforward.<br><br>
              Instead of spreading ourselves thin, we decided that we would
              all contribute where we felt the most confident: Nicole and Arina
              were both confident in user research and ideation, while Chintan
              and I found our strengths in high-fidelity prototyping. While we
              all contributed from the beginning to end, no matter where our
              speciality lied, <strong>we funneled our focus and attention where we
                felt the most confident and felt the happiest doing.</strong></p>
